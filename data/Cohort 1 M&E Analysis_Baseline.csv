Participation: attendance at work/school, leaving early. Ability to concentrate, perceived change in academic performance. Work/school, social, and religious activities missed during and because of menstruation and why.
MSRH Symptoms: self-report of rash, itching, sores, burning whilst urinating, vulval pain, abnormal discharge or smell during or not during menstruation. The number of days menstruating and experiencing heavy flow. PMS symptoms.
Menstrual Economics: amount spent on commercial products last period, source of money (adolescent). Amount spent/household on commercial products in last month (adult), number of menstruators in a household, number of menstruators using commercial products.
A small study looking at additional financial burden in adults: analgesics, water, soap, transportation, etc. and how that spending changed with reusable products.
Menstrual Practices: menstrual product used, how washed, dried, stored, disposed of. Frequency of changing.
Confidence: confidence to take part in and perform all regular tasks during menstruation, level of shame, willingness to speak up about (menstruation as) a problem
WASH: availability of latrines, water, and soap at work or school, privacy, and light
","These are captured in the metrics above (for example menstrual practices).
","Product usage patterns: time to use, frequency of use, the hardest part of learning to use

We do that through the following 5 main programs: 
1.	Menstrual Health Management: More than 80% of Burundian women and girls cannot afford to buy menstrual pads every month and underwear. As a solution, we make washable and reusable sanitary pad which can be worn without underwear. 
2.	Sexual and Reproductive Health Education: In Burundi, there's no specific SRH program in the Educational Curriculum. To fill the gap, we have developed tools to sensitize youth and their parents on Sexual and Reproductive Health, encourage responsible behaviours. 
3.	WASH in schools: The level of hygiene in most schools in Burundi is alarming. As solution, The “ishure y’inyenyeri” (“star school”, in Kirundi) program aims to help schools improve their hygiene conditions, by rating the available WASH facilities and programs in schools.  
4.	Isuku project which means ""hygiene"" in Kirundi: We teach them skills in modern cleaning and maintenance techniques, for homes and other premises; to promote Hygiene among communities. 
5.	The ""Iterambere"" initiative - meaning ""development"" in Kirundi, aims to promote entrepreneurship and strengthen financial literacy and independence. 
","1.	In Agateka program : We manufacture washable and reusable sanitary pads. We sell our pads for 5 US$ or 10,000 BIF per kit - each kit includes 5 pads and four strings and has a lifetime of up to 5 years. Half of our proceeds from our sales are directed towards our ""Agateka kw'ishure"" (Dignity at school) program through which we provide free Agateka kits to school girls and disadvantaged women all over Burundi. The production of the Agateka pads is an income generating activity for 100 women mentored under the Terintambwe initiative. Whereas we have our own production, marketing and distribution strategies, we love partnering with other individuals and organizations who can reach further than we have. 

2.	Sexual and Reproductive Health Education Program: we have developed tools to sensitize youth and their parents on Sexual and Reproductive Health, and encourage responsible behaviours: 
a.	SMS - we are the only organization in Burundi that uses the SMS approach, very effective in terms of results. It allows us to reach all our beneficiaries quickly and in real time, and gives them the opportunity to participate directly, free of charge, by privately asking individual questions, at all times. Being aware that not everyone has access to a mobile phone, our beneficiaries are organized in groups where each person who receives an SMS is required to share its contents with 5 friends who don't have phones. This approach earned us the Segal Family Foundation's Innovative Project Award in 2013.
b.	Video - we produce and screen films and documentaries on various topics related to Sexual and Reproductive Health, such as the menstrual cycle, puberty, boy-girl relationships, sexually transmitted infections, modern contraceptive methods, etc.
c.	Leaflets. : we produce leaflets on various topics related to Sexual and Reproductive Health, such as the menstrual cycle, puberty, boy-girl relationships, sexually transmitted infections, modern contraceptive methods. 
d.	SaCoDé’s Community health Center: To better help the population of  Gatumba to have quality health services related to sexual and Reproductive Health, SaCoDé has set up a health center within its community center located in the MUSHASHA 2 Quarter of Gatumba zone at the boarder of Burundi and Congo.
In order to be able to reach the entire population of Gatumba SaCoDé has set up a System of Community Health Workers who act as a relay between the community and the Gatumba SaCoDé health center.
The system consists of:
•	100 community health workers based among communities
•	10 community health workers in charge of the hills.
•	One nurse supervisor.
Role of community health workers
Gatumba has nine hills and each hill will have 11 CHW living on the hill whose role is to:
-	To set up at least three solidarity groups, each composed of 30 women who will save a little money they have to be able to buy in turn the washable and reusable 
-	sanitary napkin and thus overcome infections due to poor hygiene during menstruation. After buying Agateka pads, they continue to save money for doing income generating activities.
-	Visiting households to sensitize women on adherence to contraceptive methods in order to counter the soaring population and thus overcome poverty.
-	Sensitize pregnant women in the community on the completeness of prenatal consultations.
-	To detect and treat malaria in the community in children under 5 years of age.
-	Screening and guiding malnourished children in the community for better care.
-	Accompanying women during childbirth

3.	WASH in schools: In this program we use the “star school” approach. The program aims to help schools improve their hygiene conditions, by rating the available facilities and programs. Our rating system consists of 3 stars, attributed considering:
a)	The availability and condition of WASH infrastructure.
b)	The availability of drinking water for students.
c)	The availability of functioning and clean toilets separate for boys and girls.
d)	Existence and frequency of supervised group hand washing sessions with soap, usually before school lunch.
e)	Existence and frequency of supervised toilet cleaning sessions with supply of soap and water.
f)	Existence and frequency of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights and Menstrual Hygiene Management training and information sessions.

g)	We then help administrators and students improve their schools’ ratings by:
h)	Reaching out to partner organizations that can provide lacking water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure. 
i)	Providing Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights training and information sessions as well as reusable and washable sanitary pads to vulnerable students, as part of our “Agateka kwishure” initiative.
 
4.	The ""Isuku"" project - which means ""hygiene"" in Kirundi, is an initiative intended primarily to promote hygiene among community and to train economically disadvantaged women. We teach them skills in modern cleaning and maintenance techniques, for homes and other premises; to promote health and contribute to the reduction of dirty hands diseases. Our courses, which are sanctioned by a certificate, not only develop technical skills, but also effectively encourage to the desired behavioural changes within communities.
 
One of the project goals is to promote the work of women through enhancing their capacities. At the end of their training, our graduates are sent on work placements in different hotels and establishments in the city, and some are offered full-time jobs. The impact of Isuku on the community are huge and visible, through the health of families and their income increase when our graduates find employment. Furthermore, the women who find work are trained in saving, lending and trading, and are helped to open bank accounts. This is so they do not become dependent on their salaries, learn to save, and think of initiating projects that will further increase the quality of their lives.

5.	The ""Iterambere"" initiative - meaning ""development"" in Kirundi, aims to promote entrepreneurship and strengthen financial literacy and independence. The program was inspired by a previous partnership with CARE International and more specifically the ""Nawe Nuze"" approach (""join us"" in Kirundi), which is based on the creation of village associations (VSLA) that encourage people to save and then mutually lend each other money. These associations, which are fully managed by the villagers themselves, have helped the disadvantaged to have access to capital investment, and in some cases they have led to the establishment of small businesses.
 
We facilitate the creation of VSLAs in our areas of intervention, provide free space for the groups to meet at our Community Centres, and facilitate and guarantee connections to microfinance/banking institutions, suppliers, markets, tax collectors, insurance companies and other services they may need. Since individual support is necessary, Sacodé uses the SMS approach to educate our beneficiaries in financial management and business management. We supplement these lessons with information on reproductive and sexual health and family planning, because we believe that good health is the foundation of any success. 

","Our program, products design and services are girls centered because we know that adolescent girls are particularly vulnerable to HIV, sexually transmitted diseases, and unwanted pregnancy in many settings. Preventing adolescents unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted and HIV infections means raising their visibility within their communities, in their schools, empowering them with knowledge and skills on menstrual health and sexual and reproductive health, and providing them with social protection by breaking all social taboos, safe spaces (youth friendly health Center) and access to family planning and reproductive health, sanitary pads and appropriate wash facilities . All the 5 programs executed at SaCoDé aim to reduce girls’ risks and increase their opportunities by building their protective assets and translating evidence on what works into girl-centered programming.

Their patterns of sexual behavior and aspirations in regard to relationships are, also, in no way different. This is very different from the common assumptions concerning the disabled people. At SaCoDé, all our programs, services and products target all girls with or without disabilities because we know that they all have the same needs concerning access to information related to sexual and reproductive health, menstrual health management and access to products such sanitary pads. The impact we want from the margins group is to reduce all the unwanted pregnancies and the sexually transmitted diseases. We do what we do for them because we know that our program and products will allow them to live their menstruation peacefully with dignity.

",No,"1,247,827,965 BIF","1.	At SaCoDé, we set targets for performance indicators after the baseline study.
The baseline survey is an important part of SaCoDés M&E process. The study is done at the beginning of any SaCoDé project in order to establish the current status of a population before a project is rolled out. Through its results, the baseline serves as a benchmark for all future activities, where project managers can refer to for the purposes of making project management decisions. It is a starting point for a project.

2.	Establishing priority targets/planning: Baseline studies are important in establishing priority targets for a project. For example the SaCoDé’s Menstrual Health and Hygiene program has several objectives. The results of the baseline study done has shown us some aspects of the program which will need more focus than other, like school absenteeism due to lack of sanitary pads, lack of appropriate toilets ect…, but there are some others aspects which will need little focus. In few words, the baseline study has helped us to set up keys indicators which will help us to monitor our performance and measure the impact.  

3.	Baseline tools are used for evaluation: the tools used during a baseline study are the same tools used during evaluation. 
","For the Menstrual Health Hygiene, we did a proper baseline study with the Grand Challenges Canada grant which started in 2019. We started to track the indicators in 2019. Depending on the indicators, the monitoring of these indicators is done

","We record and monitor the school absences and the number of days missed per month before and after the AGATEKA pads distribution.
During an evaluation study in 2019 in Cibitoke partner schools, data showed that 51.6% of girls did skip school days due to menstruation at the start of the project; with an average of 2.5 days skipped per month. At the end of the project, 25.7% of girls already having their periods testified to skip at least 1 day and the average is 1.7 days per month.
Teachers (81.9%) also observed that at the end of the project the number of absences of girls during their periods has decreased.
","We monitor the change in discussing menstruation and related topics (breaking the taboo around menstruation). 
In the same evaluation study in 2019, at the beggining of the project, the girls interviewed declared that they did not discuss about menstruation or changes that occur at puberty and that the usage of old pieces had consequences such as leakage, infections, burning sensations or the obligation to change the material after a short time.
At the end of the project, 96.7% of teachers stated that they teach hygiene in class and 92% declared that they teach menstrual hygiene management to the students. 
All the teachers who participated in the evaluation think that menstrual hygiene management is important to girls because it gives insight on how to behave during that period and 85.7% of teachers think that the topic is important to boys as well. 

&gt; We also monitor the attitude of boys regarding menstruating girls at school.
In 2019, boys were asked how they treat girls who are in their periods. They provided different answers; some said that they treat them well, and did not mock them; others stated that they encourage them to practice hygiene regularly; others advised them to avoid having sexual intercourses; others said that when it comes to accomplishing tiresome duties, girls are spared. In addition, 65.1% of boys also declared that discussing about menstruation is not prohibited or shameful.
","At the end of the project in Cibitoke in 2019, 98.5% of girls testified to use sanitary pads either disposable or washable of whom 67.1% did specify that they were using the washable sanitary pads that were distributed during the project, the others used disposable ones. 
Girls testified that the sanitary pads distributed during the project were very important because students who were missing classes due to the lack of money to buy disposable pads every month were now able to follow courses during their periods. Another observation made by the students is that the received sanitary pads, contrary to the disposable ones, did not cause them allergies.

",No,,SaCoD's has an organizational strategic plan for growth for the next three years.,"Yes, I feel able to balance my purpose, passion, and drive to create impact in the world with the other demands in my life because I do love everything I am doing. 
First all I don’t try to be all things to all people, I just focus on mystrengths and outsource the others. I always plan my time even though I do have many things to do all the time. I always have time for myself, my spiritual health, my prayers and quite moments. I always have time for my family and for my physical health, do exercise and cook for my family.
At work, I have tried to make life easy with technology. We have a financial system: Quick book makes our accounts clear. We use kobo to collect our datas and Quiz SMS for our evaluation. 
","As a committed ambassador of women and youth, I share with my entire work team the vision and mission of the organization and invite them to be role models in their communities and real agents of change. Having a team spirit, I offer my team space for innovation and creativity to grow their professional carriers through transparent communication, accountability, self-development, listening to everyone's contribution and many alike. To ensure proper management, I practice delegation of authority especially in the centers upcountry with the purpose to make them autonomous. When challenges arise, I am flexible in changing strategies to reach the desired goal. Managing the team has never been an easy task, sometimes I train them to work under pressure for better performance. In hardships, I encourage the members of my team to be fearless and bring forth solutions instead of giving up.","As a leader and a manager, I hope to grow my passion for women and girls empowerment's. I know very well my motivation in all I do, that is the reason why no obstacles can keep me from growing, I will always find a way even though it is sometime very hard. I also know my weakness that is the reason why I have applied to the DUI accelerators in order to heal them and grow my impact. Through the DUI Innovation accelerator, I will discover my past failures. Failure is instructive, it allows a leader to learn. My past failures will shape my growth.  After three years, I hope to grow my impact, I hope to grow in wisdom, I also hope to expand my ecosystem and create an environment in which I will invest myself in order to be at my best. I will surround myself with clever people and MHH experts who will give me good advices. ","Organizationally, I feel that I have built a culture that matches my sense of purpose and passion for the work because the number of volunteers who wish to join our team is huge. It is very unfortunate that we can not house all of them. SaCoDé is a movement itself. Every volunteer, member or staff who joins SaCoDé, join a movement of empowering women and girls. That is the culture I have built. All the campaign done at SaCoDé around international women’s day or the 28th of May are all prepared by SaCoDé members and staff. SaCoDé’s social medias are good examples. ","Before building anything in life, the first needed thing is to build a strong foundation that will hold the structure in place. The structure consists of a root system that goes deep into the soil before any fruit can be produced. As I grow and scale, I feel that I can sustain a strong organisational culture because the most difficult part is done. I believe that I have built a strong foundation base on SaCoDé’s values, mission, vision and all the systems in place. All SaCoDé’s members and staff have those in their minds and they translate them in their actions","I would like to express once again my sincere thanks for being part of this accelerator.
