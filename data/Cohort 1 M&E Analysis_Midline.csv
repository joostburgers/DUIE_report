Our research showed that girls primarily received their menstrual health education from adults in their community, and that the culture of menstrual stigma and taboos, is the resulting trickle down effect of uninformed adults educating girls about menstruation. This is a long-standing cultural norm that is not likely to change in many rural; often conservative communities where the need for menstrual health education is most dire. Twende will tackle this right from the source, ensuring girls are getting the right information, and practical skills for menstruation. Adults will receive training and education from local agents who will cover even the most remote, hard to reach regions, and working alongside cultural norms to ensure girls receive better information from the onset.

This includes women and girls who do not have access to hygienic menstrual management products. It is estimated that 80% of Burundian women cannot afford pads and underwear to use every month when they are on their periods. The cheapest (disposable) pads available on the market cost 2000 BIF (approximately 1.5 CAD): this is a lot of money to spend every month for many families, in a country whose GDP per capita is approximately 280 CAD. As a result, women and girls resort to unhygienic and undignified methods to manage their periods, such as used pieces of cloth, pieces of old mattresses or old socks filled with sand.
A study conducted by the UNICEF in Burundi in 2016 revealed that only 17.1% of female students could afford the disposable pads available on the market. Furthermore, 70.2% of female students missed school during their periods. 88.3% of school principals and teachers interviewed as part of the study confirmed these numbers.
The global health problem we are targeting is unhygienic menstrual management. The health burdens of this problem in Burundi are huge: repetitive infections of private parts, embarrassment and low self-esteem, fear caused by cultural myths, discrimination, and the unsupportive attitudes of some boys and men

At the event, I also highlighted the amazing work of DUIA.
I have also engaged with UNICEF Country Office in many ways: 
1. In purchasing more than 8.000 kits of Agateka sanitary pads to school students. The pads were ordered by UNICEF Burundi.

2. By participating et being the main speaker in workshops organized buy the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health.
3. in the process to partner with UNICEF Country Office in a WASH project to be implemented in more than 1700 schools in Burundi.",I would like to continue engaging with UNICEF in the future in various projects aiming to protect and promote equal chances to both girls and boys to succeed in their studies.,Exploring scaling strategies and an individualized scaling plan,,Refining your business model,Expanding your ecosystem to create greater impact,Introductions to possible funders or supporters,Refining your skills communication skills/media training,Support in growing as a leader,Tailored mentorship based on your most pressing needs,Coaching calls with the DUIA team,"Connections, or access, to conferences and global gatherings",Peer support and camaraderie,"Engaging Duke undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty in your work",,,,"Yes, we have increased  Quantity and Quality of impact by diversify the communities we serve, which means that we have expanded geographically. We have opened more Agateka production centers. We also worked more on our marketing strategy to promote Agateka pads among communities.
We have also influenced the Ministry of Education to adopt the three stars school which consider all the component of WASH in school environment. 
Through Village and Saving loans associations we have established (more than 1700 groups established in 2020; we are setting up a social movement on Menstrual Health to break all social taboos and stigma related to Menstrual Health in Burundi.
The partnership with UNICEF Country Office will help us increase the number of schools to work in and the number of students to be served by our MHH model.
We still have a long way to go because behavioral change does not happen in one year. That is the reason why I continue to extend partnerships and innovate different ways of disseminating information related to MHH.
",Yes,"All the knowledge acquired through DUIA webinars have helped me and my team to contextualize and rethink how to rewrite SaCoDé Theory of Change. And I am so grateful that I have reorganized SaCoDé ecosystem. The different approaches for scaling impact have been extremely helpful and put in implementation. Our Agateka program have scaled deep, and out buy considering the keys elements for scaling. I am so grateful for the acquired knowledge which helped me to rethink our business model. The presentation on terms of “the effectiveness with which the organization is able to advocate for government actions that may work in its favor.” (Bloom & Chatterji, 2009) was very useful. In 2020, I was able to do a presentation on “Tree stars schools “in front of government representatives, which has influenced the elaboration of a new project which will be implemented in more than 1750 schools.

I am also so grateful for the new friends I have made through this accelerator, as it is always a blessing to me when I meet good people who are passionate about making this world a better place. 
","Yes, I feel that I am able to balance my purpose, passion and drive to create impact in the world with the other demands in my life. It is hard in times like this to predict what would be helpful to find or sustain a more productive balance. This Corona Virus has made life unpredictable. Let's pray for the vaccine to reach us soon.",Yes,"Yes I have grown as a leader over the course of the last year. As I mentioned before, I have now more confidence while pitching my innovation and my long term vision has never changed. ","COVID-19 has not affected my leadership at all. But, my leadership has been tried and strengthened. It is those difficult situations which  strengthened a leader.","I just wanted to express once again my sincere thanks for all the support, knowledge, guidance, and advices I have benefitted though this accelerator. They have been very beneficial to me and my team. Thank you so much ",,,,,1) Increase Quantity and/or Quality of Impact 2) Diversify Communities Served and Diversify Services Offered 3) Expand Geographically and Promote a Model 4) Establish a Social Movement and Influence Public Policy 5) Change/Create Markets,"1) At SaCoDé, we set targets for performance indicators after the baseline study. The baseline survey is an important part of SaCoDé's M&E process. The study is done at the beginning of any SaCoDé project in order to establish the current status of a population before a project is rolled out. Through its results, the baseline serves as a benchmark for all future activities, where project managers can refer to for the purposes of making project management decisions. It is a starting point for a project. 2) Establishing priority targets/planning: Baseline studies are important in establishing priority targets for a project. For example the SaCoDé’s Menstrual Health and Hygiene program has several objectives. The results of the baseline study done has shown us some aspects of the program which will need more focus than other, like school absenteeism due to lack of sanitary pads, lack of appropriate toilets etc, but there are some others aspects which will need little focus. In few words, the baseline study has helped us to set up keys indicators which will help us to monitor our performance and measure the impact. 3) Baseline tools are used for evaluation: the tools used during a baseline study are the same tools used during evaluation."
