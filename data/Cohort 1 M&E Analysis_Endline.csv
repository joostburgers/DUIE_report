Grace Françoise NIBIZI,SaCoDé,"I was very happy when SaCoDé was accepted in the Duke Unicef Accelerator program. I knew it was a God given opportunity to get more business experience and access to more capital which will allow us to scale our marketing model and product. Little did I realize how the accelerator experience would improve my organization as whole.  
Now, having completed the program, I feel that AGATEKA business plan has improved and I have sharpened our focus. I have gained new insights I hadn’t thought of, because of the mentorship, camaraderie, and the environment I was exposed to in the accelerator program.

Mentorship

The mentorship aspect of the accelerator helped to lay bare the value of our AGATEKA business, our strengths, and our weaknesses. I feel more confident about AGATEKA pads, and how to sell it. With respect to weaknesses, I am so grateful for all the advices I received from many mentors. Each had slightly different opinions about the problems we presented, enabling us to coalesce around what could be the best strategy.

Camaraderie
Being an entrepreneur can be lonely. Yes, you have your team, but there are only so many folks who decide to step out and build a startup. Your friends and family get to relax at the end of the day, but sometimes your days don’t end. We found that each of the other teams in the accelerator were in similar positions. There is comfort in knowing that you are each experiencing the same problems. While each business has different peculiarities, no one’s issues about teaming, sales, strategy, or legal issues is really all that unique.
","I would highly recommend going through an accelerator to another social entrepreur because participating in an accelerator program makes your business feel more tangible. Even if your organisation or campany has traction and revenue before starting the accelerator, which we did, the experience of participating in an accelerator raises the awareness of your organization and your product and creates positive peer pressure to succeed. Additionally, the accelerator sessions and schedule move so fast that you really feel an uptick in the pace of your work.",No (Please explain),"▪	 We have roll out of a nationwide Agateka Marketing and Branding strategy to position Agateka pads as commercial product. ( Permissions received from the Commercial Ministry)
▪	We have opened two more Agateka production workshops to cater for the increased demand for Agateka pads as a result of the Marketing and Branding Strategy. 
▪	45 additional tailors for Agateka pads have been recruited. 
1500 Community health workers have been trained on Menstrual Health and Hygiene
▪	We have changed the packaging of Agateka kits to make it more attractive and beautiful.
▪	We managed to secure un partnership with UNICEF Burundi in the WASH section: We have purchased more than 10,000 kits of Agateka pads and built hand washing devices in 191 schools with 238,523 students (119,604 girls and 118,919 boys)
▪	We managed to secure un partnership with World Vision for production of Agateka pads for schools girls, 40.000 kits have been purchased so far.
▪	We have started to advocate for the detaxation of sanitary products and materials used to make reusable and washable sanitary pads.
▪	We have also started to advocate for the free supply of sanitary products in schools.
▪	We survived the COVID 19 and learned to make masks and PPEs Being a part of the DUIA helped me navigate all the COVID 19 challenges.  
▪	With the knowledge, tools and networks acquired through webinars and catching calls in this accelerator, it helped me shape the ecosystems for SaCoDé’s team to create lasting social change. For example, the capacity building exercise has been very useful to SaCoDé team as it helped us do an auto evaluation of SACoDé in all its aspects and to rethink.
▪	We have a new and more clear Theory of change.
	
",,,Reusable menstrual products (Briefly explain),,,,,"Agateka sanitary pads:
	Are washable and reusable
	Are sewn in 100% cotton flannel fabrics, to prevent genital irritation and infections
	Include a leak-proof fabric that retains the flow inside, to ensure good protection and avoid stains on clothes
	Are the only pads in Africa which can be worn with or without underwear
	Come in three sizes: Small (pink), Medium (bleu) and Large (red)
",,,Paid educational offerings (Briefly explain),,,,,,"Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) Education: all the beneficiaries of our program are automatically included in our SRHR Education program. We use a combination of mobile phone SMS technology, educative short films and documentaries, pamphlets and “Jimbere”, a monthly education and entertainment magazine, to deliver our curriculum, which includes knowledge tests and assessments. All the materials we use were developed by SaCoDé staff and volunteers, which include health and education professionals, and have sanctioned by relevant Government bodies.

Being aware that not all our beneficiaries have access to mobile phones to receive our SMS, we always organise them in groups of 5 each, and in each group there is at least one trained Community Health Worker (CHW) who has access to a mobile phone and shares the contents of our SMS with the members of his or her group.

The CHW is a beneficiary whom we train to provide services to individuals and families in their community. These services include: culturally sensitive health education, navigating healthcare systems, speaking up effectively about medical concerns, and seeking available assistance resources. The CHW are very crucial to the success of our projects. They are trained and equipped with telephones, and they are the ones who give us regular information about the impact of our projects. Currently, we have 5,689 CHW registered in our database.

The end line study we did helped us to asses the improvement of MHM knowledge, attitudes and practices in four schools of two Kirundo communes that have benefited from the whole package of AGATEKA programme activities. 
2.	The study was organized by combining qualitative and quantitative methods. After the document review and the interview with the resource persons, the mission led the focus groups around the schools selected for the baseline study. A total of 4 FG were conducted. This step was combined with the collection of secondary data and interviews with principals, teachers, parents in the target schools. Per school, 1 shool principal, 2 teachers (a woman and a man), 2 parents (a woman and a man; whose child benefitted from AGATEKA sanitary pads) were interviewed. At the same time, a survey was being conducted in each school at the rate of 100 girls.
3.	The beneficiary schoolgirls in the target area are mainly young and are from a rural background, with an average age of 14.6 years and 90.3% living in rural areas. The income level of their parents/guardians is very low; 88% of them are farmers. Regarding their religion, Catholics and Protestants represent 49.8% and 39.3% respectively. Most of the respondent (80.3%%) are taught by men only. 
4.	All schools have separated latrines but unsufficient compared to the number of students.  Some latrin cabins cannot be closed from the inside. No school have a drinking water source in the compound. Toilets cleaning is satisfying for 87.8%. 
5.	Hand-washing practices with soap are implemented for 84% of our respondent. Soaps are given by schools but not available everytime.
6.	During the survey, 100% of girls say they know what menstruation is and 94.5% give a correct definition.  
7.	Practices related to menstruation are improving: 97.7% use AGATEKA sanitary pads, 98.1% change themselves in the recommended interval of four to six hours and 80% are satisfied with their level of hygiene. 
8.	Menstruation-related school absences have decreased; 28.2% miss school due to menstruation. 
9.	This school absenteeism is mainly due to pain (61%), lack of adequate MHM materials (28%) and fear of staining clothes (27%). No school has pain medication.
10.	The common feature of all schools is the lack of MHM rooms reserved for girls during menstruation; 96.1% of girls say that their schools do not have MHM rooms.
11.	MHM advisors at school are present according to 86.5% of girls. The latter are school aunties/uncles for 85.2%. Those have been trained during this project.  
12.	MHM education based on school clubs is effective for 80.3%. Menstruation is no longer a taboo in school for 64.3%.  
13.	This end line study has formulated recommendations. The first for Ministry of Education is to ensure that schools are built in locations that allow water sources to reach the compounds, to include change chambers (MHM rooms) in the school designing and to make soap available at all times in schools. 
14.	The integration of MHM and SRHRAY into basic teaching policies, curricula and strategies for for aspiring teachers.  Capacity building for current in-service teachers on MHM and SRHRAY should be provided throughout the country.  
15.	Activities related to hygiene should be funded, daily and supervised on every school.
16.	SaCoDé will continue to advocate for the inclusion of periodic protections as a basic necessity whether to the governmental level as well as in other NGOs activities.  To improve the hygiene and dignity of underprivileged girls and women is critical in all actions aiming at development.

This includes women and girls who do not have access to hygienic menstrual management products. It is estimated that 80% of Burundian women cannot afford pads and underwear to use every month when they are on their periods. The cheapest (disposable) pads available on the market cost 2000 BIF (approximately 1.5 CAD): this is a lot of money to spend every month for many families, in a country whose GDP per capita is approximately 280 CAD. As a result, women and girls resort to unhygienic and undignified methods to manage their periods, such as used pieces of cloth, pieces of old mattresses or old socks filled with sand.A study conducted by the UNICEF in Burundi in 2016 revealed that only 17.1% of female students could afford the disposable pads available on the market. Furthermore, 70.2% of female students missed school during their periods. 88.3% of school principals and teachers interviewed as part of the study confirmed these numbers.The global health problem we are targeting is unhygienic menstrual management. The health burdens of this problem in Burundi are huge: repetitive infections of private parts, embarrassment and low self-esteem, fear caused by cultural myths, discrimination, and the unsupportive attitudes of some boys and men",54,24,120,114,0-10,"Grace Francoise NIBIZI: Founder & Executive Director / FEMALE Karl Chris Robert: Deputy Executive Director / MALE, Dr Djida Marléne KANEZA: Agateka Programe Coordinator / FEMALE, Dr Arthur BISORE ; SRHR Program Coordinator/ MALE, Rebecca Furaha: Finance & Administrative Manager / Female, Annick INAMAHORO / Human Ressources Manager,","Dr Nshimirimana Tharcisse / Male, Grace Francoise NIBIZI/ Female, Karl Chris NSABIYUMVA / Male, Teta Queen / Female, Kagabo Ralph/ Male,",No,,,No,,5-10,"Total # of girls/women users of AGATEKA sanitary pads distributed in schools, VSLA and communities.

The baseline survey is an important part of SaCoDés M&E process. The study is done at the beginning of any SaCoDé project in order to establish the current status of a population before a project is rolled out. Through its results, the baseline serves as a benchmark for all future activities, where project managers can refer to for the purposes of making project management decisions. It is a starting point for a project. 2. Establishing priority targets/planning: Baseline studies are important in establishing priority targets for a project. For example the SaCoDé’s Menstrual Health and Hygiene program has several objectives. The results of the baseline study done has shown us some aspects of the program which will need more focus than other, like school absenteeism due to lack of sanitary pads, lack of appropriate toilets ect…, but there are some others aspects which will need little focus. In few words, the baseline study has helped us to set up keys indicators which will help us to monitor our performance and measure the impact. 3.
